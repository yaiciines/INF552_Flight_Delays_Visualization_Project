# NF552 Data Visualization - Flight Delays Visualization Project

We present a visualization project focused on the analysis of flight delays. Using a comprehensive dataset, our goal is to identify patterns and causes of delays in the aviation industry. This analysis aims to provide insights that can help reduce delays and improve the passenger experience. The project combines detailed data analysis with innovative visualization techniques to make complex flight delay information accessible and understandable.
